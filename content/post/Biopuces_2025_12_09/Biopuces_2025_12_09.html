<p>Séance exceptionnelle en collaboration avec le réseau <a href="https://stateofther.netlify.app/">StateOftheR</a>, présentation d’Arthur Tenenhaus autour de l’analyse de données multi-blocs avec le package R <em>RGCCA</em>.</p>
<p>Multiblock data analysis with the RGCCA package</p>
<p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
<p>Multiblock component methods are essential tools for exploring complex relationships between
multiple sets of variables. Although various statistical methods and dedicated software for
multiblock data analysis exist, Regularized Generalized Canonical Correlation Analysis (RGCCA)
offers a unified and versatile framework that consolidates more than six decades of multiblock
component methods. During this half-day practical session, we will present the RGCCA framework
and the RGCCA package, which implements this framework and goes beyond by providing graphical
outputs and statistical tools to assess the robustness and significance of the analysis. The usefulness
of the RGCCA package will be illustrated through two real-world case studies. The package is freely
available from the Comprehensive R Archive Network (CRAN) at <a href="https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RGCCA" class="uri">https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=RGCCA</a> and
from GitHub at <a href="https://github.com/rgcca-factory/RGCCA" class="uri">https://github.com/rgcca-factory/RGCCA</a>.</p>
